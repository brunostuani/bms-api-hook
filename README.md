# BMS API Hook

Pascal/Delphi API and Code hook library built for 32 bits Windows. Contains DLL and code injection, remote process code execution, inter process communication and mini code disassembler techniques.

This is an old library I wrote back in 2005. I actually doubt that this is still working. With advancements of Windows operational system and the introduction of 64 bits processes this code became deprecated.

It should, however, be very interesting for learning purposes. With this library I was able to create things such as:

* Counter Strike wall hacks;
* General MMORPG socket packet interception and modification;
* Internet packet debuggers;
* Google Talk hacking (GT-Plug was created using it);
* AntiVirus softwares;
* etc.

Please leave me a message if this is useful for you. Feel free to use it anyhow you'd like to :)
